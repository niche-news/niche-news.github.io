Hello, I'm Alden Lamp, a developer at Niche News. I mainly do iOS development, but in this project I am doing database administration as well. Coding allows me to make a difference by contributing to project I believe in. I wanted to help out with Niche News because I see the importance of staying updated in today's world.
