Anthony Kennedy, who was appointed as Justice of the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan, has been working on the Court for thirty years. A week ago, Kennedy has announced that he will be retiring at the end of July. 

Kennedy was known as the ‘swing vote’ of the Supreme Court, who often bridged the gap between the court’s liberals and conservatives. As swing vote, Kennedy was able to look at both sides and come up with a reasonable agreement. Kennedy has changed America through many vital decisions such as the right to abortion, banning the death penalty for juveniles, and legalizing gay marriage. 

Supreme Court judges are able to keep their position until they die. Why did Kennedy decide to step down? Kennedy stated that his decision to step down was based on a “deep desire to spend more time with his family”. By retiring, Kennedy also gives an opportunity for another qualified justice to take his position, rather than cling onto it forever. 

The White House states: “Justice Kennedy has been a tireless voice for individual rights and the Founders' enduring vision of limited government. His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history." Kennedy will officially leave office on July 31.
