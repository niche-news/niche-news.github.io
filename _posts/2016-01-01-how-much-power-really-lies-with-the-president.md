<b>Disclaimer: This article mentions the 9/11 attacks and discusses military conflicts</b>

The old belief that ‘Only Congress has the power to declare war’ has been undermined as a presidential grab for power threatens the balance of power in our government. In the wake of the September 11th attacks on our nation, the office of the president has snatched broad and unyielding power over our troops and US Foreign policy via two main pieces of legislation: The “Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and Title 3093.
The AUMF was designed to allow the president to pursue all terrorists and terrorist organizations related to the 9/11 attacks. The law is very straightforward and short: “the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.” It seems reasonable and rational, but presidential lawyers have been able to exploit its vague language. Phrases such as “all necessary and appropriate force” are open to interpretation and have been utilized to justify 37 interventions in areas like Niger and Chad - countries who were not related to the 9/11 attacks according to govTrack. But the more damning piece of legislation is Title 3093. Even more vague than its predecessor, title 3093 gives the president the ability to execute covert operations if “the President determines such an action is important to the national security of the United States”.
These documents give the president power to intervene and start a military conflict in any area in the world whenever. Many claim that US military intervention seems to have benefits, such as strengthening US hegemony, protecting US interests, and paving a way towards peace, but the empirical evidence paints a different story. Bergen finds that historically US presence has increased violence by 265%. Problematically, he sees that in the case of Iraq, US intervention increased attacks by 607%. But this begs the question, why does intervention provoke conflict?
First, he finds that military intervention likely triggers a “gloves off” mentality that dramatically escalates the violence on both sides”. That's why Sousa of the International Studies Association finds that military intervention increases conflict intensity by 16%. Secondly, US intervention crafts an anti-american sentiment. When citizens see a foreign power militarily ‘invading’ their country it sparks a nationalist response, harkening back to the anti-colonial sentiments of the 19th century. It radicalizes citizens, as Pape finds that intervention has caused 95% of all suicide terrorism.
But all hope is not lost. The War powers act of 1973 states that the President must tell Congress within 48 hours if he sends armed forces anywhere, and Congress must give approval for the military to stay there for more than 90 days. However, unfortunately the executive branch has yet to acknowledge the constitutionality of this act, as all former commander in chiefs have simply ignored it.
