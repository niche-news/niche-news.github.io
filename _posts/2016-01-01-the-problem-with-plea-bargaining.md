Plea bargains are, paradoxically, one of the most prominent yet subtle components of the legal system. They influence a solid 90% of cases that pass through the criminal justice system, yet by nature, we hear little about them. Regardless, they have come to play a pivotal role in the trial process, for better or for worse.

Plea bargains emerged in an effort to limit lengthy and expensive cases that were hindering the effectiveness of the legal system. Judges were experiencing “court clog”, where defendants could be forced to wait months for a trial since due to the time needed to resolve other complex cases. Thus, the plea bargain: prosecutors and defendants make a deal where the defendant agrees to confess (or “plead”) their guilt in exchange for reduced sentence or charges. For example, a man charged with murder confess their guilt and in turn receive a reduced sentence or be charged with a lesser crime. The criminal justice system has used this tool since the 1960s in an effort to reduce costs and length of a trial. By having the defendant admit their guilt, courts can, in theory, dispose of cases more quickly and ensure efficiency in the trial process.

The use of plea bargains, however, has only harmed the trial process rather than facilitated it. First, it has exacerbated, not alleviated, the costs and length of trials. Second, it has unfairly targeted minorities and people of color and has increased racial bias in the criminal justice system. Third, and finally, plea bargains go against the very foundation of the supposed “justice” system by coercing innocent people to falsely admit guilt.
Though the purpose of plea bargains is to speed up trials and make the legal system more efficient, their use has only compounded the problem of “clogged” courts. In theory, faster trials should mean less court clog, but the opposite has been proven to be true. The use of plea bargains has sped up convictions of crimes, most of which are smaller cases such drug misdemeanors and petty crimes. By having such a high turnover rate, prosecutors demonstrate their effectiveness in fighting crime. However, the incentive to prosecute more defendants has led to an increase in convictions for such lower-level crimes, fueling mass incarceration. As a result, prosecutors convict more and more people for relatively minor crimes instead of focusing on larger, white-collar cases, which has actually increased court clog. Rather than making the legal system more efficient, plea bargains have only aggravated the problem.

In addition to failing to fulfill their original purpose, plea bargains exacerbate existing inequalities within the legal system and society. Studies conducted in 2017 found that the deals offered to people of color are significantly worse than those offered to white people, and that white people are 74% more likely than black people to have charges completely dropped. The use of plea bargains has led to the overt display of racial bias and has pressured people of color to take harmful bargains simply because they save time. In a failed effort to increase efficiency, the legal system has merely provided an avenue for discrimination against people of color. The criminal justice system has allowed for unequal treatment, the antithesis of “justice” for all.

The deterioration of justice is compounded by the coercive practices used in plea bargains. The definition of plea bargaining may lead one to believe that the agreement reached is fair and in the defendant’s interest. By providing an opportunity for compromise, the justice system, in theory, is expanding the freedom of all parties involved. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The bargain reached is more often than not a result of coercion and strong-arming the defendant into pleading guilty. Prosecutors often threaten defendants with higher charges and greater punishments if they do not plead guilty - essentially a legal form of torture. This has led to many innocents pleading guilty out of fear of the potential of an enormously large punishment. In fact, scholars have argued that the coercive nature of plea bargaining is in violation of many constitutional amendments, such as the right to trial by jury. In effect, plea bargaining has foiled the original purpose of the criminal justice system; rather than finding the truth and protecting rights, courts convict innocents and violate constitutional amendments.

Plea bargains have gone against their original purpose of improving court efficiency, and have instead slowed down our courts and led to discrimination and coercion. Many scholars have proposed possible reforms and even abolition of the practice. In any case, there must be a change in the use of plea bargains that have undermined the “justice” in the criminal justice system.
