Recently, for a variety of reasons ranging from environmental concerns to practicality electric cars have occupied a sort of niche in car sales. The range of cars is huge, ranging from luxury electric cars such as those made by Fisker to electric 16 wheelers set to be made by Tesla. For many, electric cars quite simply seem to be the cars of the future in an age where gas consumption and dirty emissions are increasingly feared. 

Now no car is a small purchase, but electric cars are on balance even larger investments, with some Tesla models selling for upwards of 100 thousand dollars. The issue them becomes affordability of electric cars. 

Electric cars in the status quo are given a government rebate of $7500 upon purchase (although this rebait’s imminent future is unknown because of America’s current political climate). This certainly helps affordability for Electric cars. 

However, when considering purchasing an electric car one must consider the reality of electric technology today. Electric technology is advancing exponentially, and the performance and affordability of electric cars is bound to follow the advances in technology. 
Consider this. Imagine buying an iPhone 7 except that instead of costing a few hundred dollars it was $100,000. Knowing that the phones technology would be obsolete within a year this would be an absolutely absurd purchase. 

The same logic can be applied to electric cars. When technology advances very quickly an electric car purchased today is guaranteed to be technologically obsolete within a few years. Therefore, it is much smarter, if you set on driving an electric car to lease it, as to avoid deprecation and also have an up to date car. 

Depreciation has also been a major problem with electric cars. Take the 2012 Nissan Leaf, an electric car that would have sold for $30,000 new. That car would be worth $8,500 today. A similarly priced same year Nissan Altima that is gas powered would be worth $13,000 today. The difference is huge.

Ultimately, electric cars today are a shadow of the greatness they promise to bring tomorrow. Yes, in order to show support for electric cars people do have to purchase or lease them, but for your pocketbooks sake I would recommend leasing.
