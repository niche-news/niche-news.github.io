Two years ago, Congress entertained the idea to have women register for the possibility of a draft, the same way that every man from the ages of 18 to 26 has to register for the possibility of a draft. Two months later, Congress dropped the idea and indefinitely shelved any future plans to amend this decision. 

But before we delve into the implications that this legislation and its outcome has on the fight for gender equality and the deeper analysis of what the draft would mean in the context of military reform, there are a few questions to clarify:

What is a draft? To put it simply, if you’re male, sometime around your 18th birthday, you receive a letter from the United States Government. After overcoming your initial panic thinking that Big Brother has finally looked at your search history and is coming to throw you in jail, you grab a pen from the floor and violently stab the envelope. You quickly get through several lengthy paragraphs of nonsense before looking up in a grimace thinking, Big Brother wants me to go to war? Yes. Well, kind of. Not really. That’s what the papers say though, they tell you that you have to register for “possible military service.” But how possible is “possible?” Good question. In this day and age, where the entire United States Army is made up of volunteers, chances are you won’t be drafted, not even if we have another world war (prays constantly to Hogwarts for protection.) So, why do we even want to draft women if we don’t need it?

Now here’s where we get to the implications of the draft on gender equality. Passing this legislation probably won’t mean much more in the context of the strength of the military than me having to stab my own envelope at 18 along with a few million other women, and we probably won’t have to lift up a weapon if we don’t want to. But the impacts stretch further than any meaningless government envelope forcing you to fill out two hours worth of paperwork, further than just another stance for gender equality. This legislation has the power to be more than just a symbolic testament to the fight for gender equality, it has the power to revolutionize the way women are treated in the military, in terms of the the daily harassment and the fallout of what happens when a woman tries to fight back.

But how? All it does is have women also sign up for possible (but not really) military service. Yes. Exactly. That’s all it needs to do. Just the possibility of a draft of both men and women is enough for the army to make changes in their policies against sexual harassment in the army, a problem that we all can see growing but can’t (or won’t) do anything to fix. Just the possibility of having more women in the army is enough ammunition for the public, for congress, for female soldiers to push back against the deeply misogynistic and backwards policy that exists in the military for the prosecution of heinous and disturbing abuse. And right now, there is little that the public or female soldiers themselves can do about the abuse that plagues the military because the people that are responsible upholding the law and administering justice for the people that protect our country don’t follow through on this responsibility. The military has a unique court system in which justice is not their priority, unity is. And to the military, unity does not include women. The misogyny is so deeply rooted, causing the Pentagon’s courts to ignore or shutdown cases that threatens the hierarchy of males that exists in our protection. The way that the Pentagon operates around justice is interesting… to say the least. They have in place the defendant’s superior to serve as a jury and makes the decision of whether charges should be brought against the defendant, even though he/she has no legal training. Yes, you read this right. The defendant’s own superior is responsible for deciding whether or not the defendant gets pressed with charges. I don’t need to explain what happens in this situation. The notion that female soldiers do not deserve equal respect as male soldiers that shadows every base camp, court, and training center is only given more power under this system, and the is nothing we can do about it. Except this draft.

Um what? Everything I’ve read so far tells me that the military is a terrible place for women. Why do we want to send more women there? That’s the argument that everyone who opposes the draft espouses, that forcing possible military service on more women will only increase the amount of women that are raped and abused without justice. Change before draft, they say. Not only is this argument completely wrong, but it mistakenly places the assumption that the military will change its decade long policy of marginalizing sexual assault and objectifying the women that they work with. They won’t change, not unless they are forced to by changing circumstances, for example, more women, more women who won’t be touched and will stand up and fight for their rights. 
As of April 2017, the Pew Research Center reports show that women make up roughly 14% of the Army. That statistic maintains pretty steadily through the Navy, Air force, and Marines with little variation. 14%. That’s it. With that number, it’s no wonder that there is no representation for women in Pentagon courts. “Change before draft” will never happen, it’s lost cause and is how we have let the problem grow so big. But we can still fix it, by adding more women into the military’s consideration, more women that the military has to accommodate for legally. More women means more voices to bring assault to the center stage and end it once and for all. There’s still time.
