Whether it was your childhood or just one year ago, the retailer “Toys R Us” has been around since 1957, and continued to go strong until today. This store served as a paradise for many children, with all the supplies it sold ranging from toys of all sorts, video games, clothing, merchandise, and many more fun items. As a child, I always remember begging my parents to drive me over to check out what they had to offer. Walking in, the store always gave a vibrant, attractive color scheme to welcome all visitors. And once you enter, there are so many sections to visit you would not know where to start. A paradise full of toys… So what caused the downfall of this wonderful store?
There were two factors:
1. Online shopping websites such as Amazon and eBay easily outsell Toys R Us. The convenience of having the requested item delivered to your doorstep with a small shipping fee is much easier than driving out to a nearby Toys R Us, which were mostly located far away from local neighborhoods. Toys R Us stores are congregated near high traffic areas, such as highways, not the small neighborhoods where it really counts - and thats precisely what companies like Amazon took advantage of. 
2. One word: Debt . Debt stopped Toys R Us from making the necessary investments that are needed in stores. And from there, nothing but an unpleasant shopping experience would result and doom the chain. In addition, competitors such as Walmart raised wages, while Toys R Us were having trouble attracting visitors. Shopping for Toys R Us items online has already been disabled since March 2018. However, it is not too late to visit your local Toys R Us to haul some memorable souvenirs of the store before it closes for good. Our childhood store shall never be forgotten.
