Is the Illuminati real? No. There is no all-knowing power that loves triangles and watches you turn around dark corners. There may be, however, justification for the worry that someone is monitoring you on the internet and social media. Big name companies do this and are able to provide the information we want without us even knowing we wanted it – but they are not the Illuminati. Simply, companies know what we think because they are able to control how and what we think through the use of propaganda. They know what we think because this is how they have programmed us to.

They even cast their influence over the social epidemic of the time which was the stabilization of jobs – in both cases, the propaganda was used to help the society of the time. 


However, propaganda has also been used in children’s shows and pop culture to create not so positive influences on our society and to regularize traumatic events. Typically frowned upon, this topic is rarely touched due to its sensitivities – this makes it a perfect fit for Niche News, though <b><u> I suggest if you have any sensitivities to the topic then to please end your reading now as it can be quite emotional.</u></b> I would also like to take the time now to state that I take no formal claim as to whether or not the images truly depicted the incidents before they occurred/were the direct cause of such tragedies; I do, however, acknowledge the images’ existence and the eeriness they hold in the truth of their being. 

“What am I referring to?” you may be wondering. Well, I am referring to the unnumbered amount of pre-9/11 photos in existence and would like to raise the question as to whether they influenced the attackers or normalized the idea of a plane striking a building

This image was released on April 27, 2001, barely 5 months before the terrorist attack. The image of a burning building parallels the fall of the Twin Towers – this cartoon may have inspired the attack and its supporters.

This image obtains a striking resemblance – almost exact resemblance – to the photos of 9/11. How is it that this author, Jose Borja, foresaw this event? Did he have a time machine? Not likely. Did corporal geniuses pay Borja to create it so that we would begin to think of the awful tragedy an entire two decades earlier? Perhaps. Did terrorists base their idea this story in their planning of the attack? Unknown.

A horrifically looming image that suggests the intersection of a plane and two large towers over two full decades previous to the event. Same as before, should we take this as mere coincidence or is there something greater going on at hands? Whether that be a warning,<b><i> a normalization, or an inspiration to the final attack. </i></b>

Now you may be thinking, “Okay, so what? 9/11 was over ten years ago and this doesn’t happen anymore, the world is a lot safer now” … But is it? Or does enhanced security only limit your abilities? Does the constant use of gadgets steal normalize more tragedies and inspire more horrors and affect our mental states?

Continuously, as seen in the 9/11 examples, modern technology enormous influence over our population and how they standardize violence and weapons. Many claim that video games and violent toys brainwash young mind and have led to increased violence at young ages which can be viewed in the variety of shootings and school violence that have taken place. 

In this day and age, the group of profiting individuals has more access than ever to our lives and how we live them. Big name corporations such as Apple have the ability to control our phones and access to all data in them – including face recognition and fingerprints. Additionally, Siri listens to everything you say, as does the Amazon Alexa; these AI systems claim to record your conversation in order to “know more about you” and become better able to know your needs when giving directions. Similarly, have you ever noticed that your phone maps have figured out where you live based on your typical location? As well as knows your work/school based upon where you go and for what times of the day? Some may find this convenient and technologically advanced, others hopefully agree with me that it’s just downright creepy. Even though we have grown accustomed to it, <u><i> it is this shrug-off attitude towards of our lack of privacy which makes us so susceptible to being brainwashed by large organizations. As we do not object to the intrusion of these companies into our personal lives we invite them to <b>normalize more ideas and actions in our minds,</b> and consequently they yield increasing influence over us. </i></u>

If you still question the possible existence of the Illuminati then I understand why, though it is more reasonable to acknowledge the threatening power worldwide companies obtain and how they are accountable for controlling what we see and knowing what we think. Watch what you say around Siri.
